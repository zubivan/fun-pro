# Goal of this repository

This repository is used for tracking exercises from `Functional Programming in Scala` book (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala).

Examples and exercises in this book are built with Scala programming language and used as an intoduction to functional programming in general, but also as an introduction to Scala programming language.

I aim to follow this book using Scala, but also other languages, like Rust and TypeScript.

I will start rather simple, having a very basic setup for all the languages, evolving the setup as I go.
